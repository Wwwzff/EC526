To run the code on scc, you only need to input:
"./out_acc 256"
Since I have already compile the code
The number 256 represents the file you want to read. 256 means you take test256.txt as test file. 
In the repository I present 5 test txt files. All the plot images are store in res folder
The result will be written to result.txt in current repository.
When I tried to run the code on SCC, I wrote 3 versions of the sharpening filter, all of which can be run on Clion IDE, please feel free to run the code.
Please apply a GPU before running the code.
If there is any problem please contact me, my email address is zby@bu.edu
