## pixelLoader.py
read target picture and save all pixel info into the appointed directory
```
python pixelLoader.py [targetPic] [dest]
```
Output for this script is a file containing pixels' rgb value matrix and size information. For example a image file with size 2*2, the output file is like:

- 2 2
- 0 0 0 5 5 5
- 2 2 2 1 1 1

## testCaseGenerator.py
Generate data that simulates picture information with resolution from 256*256 to 8192*8192
```
python testCaseGenerator.py
```

## Serial_InterFrame_Difference.cpp
return a txt file containing difference matrix after processing
Remember to set C++ version to 11 or higher when compiling
```
g++  Serial_InterFrame_Difference.cpp -std=c++11 -o out
```

## InterFrame_Difference_OpenACC.cpp
Perform parallel code using openACC and test on Shared Computer Cluster with a tesla GPU card. There're some syntax in split function which is not supported by old version C++, so do things as showed below
```
pgc++ -Minfo=accel -fast -acc -ta=tesla:cc60 InterFrame_Difference_OpenACC.cpp -o out_acc -std=c++11
```
This version of parallel code is modified for ease of doing benchmark on test cases, so you might need to do 
```
./out_acc [128,256...]
```
which will load files with name test128_0.txt, test128_1.txt...

May need to modify some variables for running on other cases except cases generated by the script.
